## 🧠 Project Overview

### 🗺️ Part 1 – Visualizing True Voter Representation
**Goal:** Challenge the polarizing “winner map” by presenting factual voter distributions.  
**Approach:** Create alternative maps (choropleth, stacked bars) that show the full vote share and highlight misrepresentation in the relative-winner approach.

### 📊 Part 2 – Structural Data & Correlation
**Goal:** Examine socio-economic indicators that influence voting preferences.  
**Approach:** Combine `ew24_structure_data.xlsx` with election results to analyze correlations (e.g., unemployment vs AfD %, income vs FDP %).  
**Techniques:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, correlation coefficients, regression plots.

### ☁️ Part 3 – Finra Case: Cloud Migration
**Goal:** Outline how Randich can manage organizational change during Finra’s move to the cloud.  
**Deliverable:** Structured PDF analysis (1 page).

### 💰 Part 4 – NFTs as Securities
**Goal:** Determine when NFTs qualify as securities under the Howey Test.  
**Deliverable:** Comparative report (U.S., EU, China, India).

### 🚜 Part 5 – John Deere Strategic Transformation
**Goal:** Recommend strategies to increase customer adoption of digital products.  
**Deliverable:** 1-page advisory report.
